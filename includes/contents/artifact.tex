\section{Creating the Artifact(s)}

\subsection{Approaching the Creation}

\blockquote{
\textit{Note for feedback}
\textbf{This is going to be in this part:}

Transition from the design implications to the actual creation. Here the reasoning is going to be laid out on the decision of if I am going for multiple small artifacts per implication or a bigger more complete (single) artifact including multiple implications. Also the reason behind why certain implications were used are given.

\subsection{Turning Software Development Onboarding into a Space of Play}

\blockquote{
\textit{Note for feedback}
\textbf{This is going to be in this part:}

Laying out how the artifact was created. Showing the process of creation, referring to the actual code in the appendix (?), and showing the actual result.

\subsection{The Artifact(s) in the Context}

\blockquote{
\textit{Note for feedback}
\textbf{This is going to be in this part:}

After creating the artifact, it is going to be shown to a set of developers (preferrably the interviewees) to get some feedback for a short evaluation. The goal is not to quantitavely measure here, but rather to raise some points for discussion in the next chapter and to find out if further investigation into the thesis topic is sensible.
