\section{Discussion}

From guidelines

Discussion of results (justification phase): The critical discussion of the technical or analytical work steps is
presented here and the relevance to innovation is established. Comparisons with other results on similar
questions in the literature are entirely appropriate (reference to questions and knowledge gaps in existing
literature on the topic identified in the “Related Work” chapter). Arguments may also be presented here
concerning social relevance and responsibility with regard to the research question, or it may be placed it in
the context of an overall social discourse.

\textbf{This is going to be in this part:}

In this part all of the findings from the reuslt chapter, as well as how the research was done, is going to be reflected upon.

\subsection{Reflection on the Approach}

\blockquote{
\textit{Note for feedback}
\textbf{This is going to be in this part:}

Reflecting on how well the study approach worked and how valuable the resulting data was. Questions to answer:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Were the qualitative interviews a good choice?}
  \item{How diverse was the interviewee selection?}
  \item{How well did the interviews themselves work?}
  \item{How valuable was the data and how well could themes be reflected from it?}
  \item{What could have been another or better option?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevancy \& Future Implications}

Possible other implementations:

List here everything that was not done in the probe, but that came up as an idea and put it out there for future research ,e.g.

- Tell a story through git commits (e.g. text-adventure style as an additional medium)
- Procedurally generated game world, where players can destroy parts of a project to see what breaks due to that

-> And every idea from the participants of the probes

\textbf{This is going to be in this part:}

How relevant could all of the research be? Can we start to use it immediately? If not, what has to be done? How could we measure effectiveness in the future?
